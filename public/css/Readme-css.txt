1. You can find changes of each page under its own section in style.css + responsive styling in the end

2.  There are css files which where created for special cases and they need to by included by putting the file 
under the link of the header of the choosen page

3. There are 2 extra css files for different button situations:
    - 3 Blocks of buttons at the bottom part of the page -> 3-block-btn.css 
    - 2 Block buttons wich are on the lowest point of the page -> lowered-block-btn.css

4. There are 3 files for different background situations:
    - The normal style.css is full background
    - partial-bg.css is with a small image at the top + the rest is linear gradient colors
    - partial-onecolor.css is a small image at top + one color background for the rest. 
    You also need to link the right header to the page (they are similar named)

5. Footer-replace.css takes out the footer

6. no-content-wrap.css takes out the wrap of the content, which mainly makes the placing of the buttons similar.
   For the case of not having buttons it can be useful.
